00:00:01.374 --> 00:00:03.131
* Gonna have a good time *

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.508
Karate
brings the essence

00:00:34.537 --> 00:00:38.032
of ka, ra, and te

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.228
together in a circular
balance of the elements.

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:43.888
It is time for you
to demonstrate

00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:49.598
all that you have learned
about the "DUH's" of karate.

00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:51.606
Discipline.

00:00:51.644 --> 00:00:54.332
Ed-U-cation.

00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:58.144
And most importantly, Honor.

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:02.886
Honor.

00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:08.108
I, Grandmaster of
the "How To Karate" video series,

00:01:08.137 --> 00:01:12.563
am coming to your dojo
in your town of...

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:13.743
_

00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:16.566
to watch your top student perform.

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:19.158
If Grandmaster
deems them worthy,

00:01:19.187 --> 00:01:23.190
your dojo will be
How To... certified.

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:25.216
This is a great honor
for our dojo.

00:01:25.244 --> 00:01:27.865
With Grandmaster's certification,

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:29.920
we won't just be
a mini-mall dojo anymore.

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.896
We'll be a certified
mini-mall dojo.

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:36.611
The student I will choose
to represent the school

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.529
will be someone who has
constantly impressed me

00:01:39.568 --> 00:01:41.545
with their dedication
and commitment.

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:45.299
Someone who has contributed
so much to the dojo,

00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:49.235
who really puts the "ra"
in karate.

00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:52.921
I will let you know my decision
by the end of the week.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.908
Uh, sensei, it's Friday.

00:01:54.937 --> 00:01:56.924
- Oh. Then it's Jeremy.
- What?!

00:02:00.668 --> 00:02:04.480
Anyway, great class today.
You're all dismissed.

00:02:06.534 --> 00:02:08.387
How does it feel, Marco?

00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:11.334
He actually chose
an eight-year-old over you.

00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:15.241
L-o-s-e-r.
Marco lost to who?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.051
J-e-r-e-m-y.
That spells winner.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.942
That's me.
Jeremy.

00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:26.425
Yay! This is going to be
the best trip yet!

00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:29.305
- Ready to board?
- You bet, Sir Acha.

00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:32.128
Let's sail away on our friend ship.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:37.216
Hey, little buddy. What
are you doing in my room?

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.974
Hajime.

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:05.180
Whoa. That was amazing.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.867
So is Jeremy still your
choice to represent the dojo?

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:10.566
Oh. Yeah, for sure, Jeremy.

00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:13.417
What?!
I broke, like, three boards.

00:03:13.446 --> 00:03:16.585
Marco, I didn't pick Jeremy
because he's better at karate.

00:03:16.624 --> 00:03:18.505
I picked him because of...

00:03:18.544 --> 00:03:20.137
you know, who he is as a person.

00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:23.027
Who Jeremy is as a person
is a jerk.

00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:25.974
As a person?
Who do you think is a person?

00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:28.758
- Marco, listen.
- No, you listen.

00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:30.073
I'm ten times the person Jeremy is.

00:03:30.102 --> 00:03:31.964
You're making a huge mistake.

00:03:31.993 --> 00:03:35.958
Let's sail away on our friend ship.

00:03:37.475 --> 00:03:43.494
- You still have a lot to learn about honor.
- Fine.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.169
Mom, next time you cut the
crusts off, leave 'em in the bag.

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:49.388
Just 'cause I don't
want 'em on my sandwich

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:51.145
doesn't mean I don't eat 'em later.

00:03:51.184 --> 00:03:53.503
I'm sorry, my little cherub.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.833
- Is that...
- That's a hundred-dollar bill.

00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:03.738
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:04:03.772 --> 00:04:04.345
That's a Benjamin.

00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:08.387
That's my favorite one.
But it's got all that stuff on it.

00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:10.307
Yeah, it's a lot of stuff.

00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:12.899
You know how many vinyls
I could buy with that?

00:04:12.937 --> 00:04:15.107
Three.

00:04:15.145 --> 00:04:16.998
I'm going in.

00:04:17.036 --> 00:04:21.001
- Ew. Why does it smell like that?
- Pretty rank, huh?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.416
- Well, maybe if I...
- I'd start with the corner.

00:04:27.798 --> 00:04:31.446
Man. Somebody glued this
to the ground.

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:35.152
- Glue?
- What kind of a sick joke is this?

00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:36.409
Try the other corner.

00:04:40.288 --> 00:04:43.004
My glasses.
And it's my birthday!

00:04:47.526 --> 00:04:49.446
Uh, butler, refill.

00:04:56.435 --> 00:04:59.440
- Shameful.
- Hey, Marco, whatcha doing?

00:04:59.478 --> 00:05:03.030
Do you mind?
I'm collecting evidence here.

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:04.854
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:04.892 --> 00:05:06.716
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:09.817
Keep it up, Jeremy. You're
giving me everything I need.

00:05:09.856 --> 00:05:12.764
Star? What are you doing?

00:05:12.803 --> 00:05:14.684
I'm just helping you out
at the scene of the crime,

00:05:14.723 --> 00:05:21.222
- collecting evidence.
- Uh, it's not really a crime scene.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.390
I'm hiding in the bushes and
recording all of Jeremy's bad behavior.

00:05:24.428 --> 00:05:27.020
Oh, so you're like a...
like a...

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:30.899
- like a creep.
- What? No. I'm not a creep.

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:33.011
I've got lots of proof here, Star.

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.697
It's okay, Marco.
Wave that creep flag.

00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:39.318
This isn't creepy.
This is justice.

00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:41.344
I'm gonna show
all this bad stuff to sensei,

00:05:41.372 --> 00:05:42.620
and then he'll have
to change his mind

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.540
about letting Jeremy
represent the dojo.

00:05:51.793 --> 00:05:53.610
Huh?

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:05.296
- Hey, sensei.
- Mr. Diaz.

00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:07.129
There's something
I need to show you.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:10.038
If it's those pictures of
the dog playing the harmonica,

00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:13.052
I've seen them,
and they're excellent.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.001
No, no, this is not that.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.083
- It's about Jeremy.
- Okay. What is it?

00:06:18.112 --> 00:06:22.883
I wanna show you...
how...

00:06:24.457 --> 00:06:28.460
- Well?
- How... sorry I am.

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:31.312
I shouldn't have
overreacted the other day.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.107
You have every right
to choose who you want

00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:35.766
to represent the dojo.
And if you really think

00:06:35.767 --> 00:06:39.193
Jeremy is the best choice,
then I can accept that.

00:06:39.222 --> 00:06:42.870
I appreciate your apology.
It shows your noble spirit.

00:06:42.908 --> 00:06:45.596
You're like a lion,
or a really cool bird-lion.

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:47.612
Oh, man!

00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:49.724
Grandmaster's gonna
be here any minute!

00:06:49.763 --> 00:06:54.400
Or is Grandmaster
already here?

00:06:55.561 --> 00:06:59.142
Grandmaster.
Thank you for coming.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.196
Do not thank Grandmaster.

00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:06.803
It is by the will of karate
that Grandmaster is here.

00:07:06.832 --> 00:07:08.886
That's the coolest sentence
I've ever heard.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.782
Who have you chosen
to represent your dojo?

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.401
Me! Jeremy!

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.089
Yay. We love you, son.

00:07:25.158 --> 00:07:27.913
I would like to express
what a huge honor it is

00:07:27.942 --> 00:07:31.652
for all of you
to watch me perform.

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:35.785
* Jeremy is awesome *

00:07:35.824 --> 00:07:39.635
* He's the best at
everything he does *

00:07:39.664 --> 00:07:41.526
Ahem.

00:07:41.555 --> 00:07:43.187
Applause?

00:07:44.963 --> 00:07:46.979
* He's the greatest
that ever was *

00:07:47.017 --> 00:07:48.169
Yah, yah!

00:07:48.198 --> 00:07:51.078
- Mom, picture.
- Yes, sweetie.

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:54.736
- What a jerk!
- I cannot stand that boy.

00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:57.406
Why'd you bring me here
for our anniversary?

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.251
Hai.
No no, I'm not done.

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:06.006
Okay, that's it.

00:08:06.044 --> 00:08:09.088
I'm sorry, sensei.
I just can't accept this.

00:08:09.116 --> 00:08:11.008
Why did you pick Jeremy?

00:08:11.036 --> 00:08:13.820
Because he brings so much
to the dojo.

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:18.438
- So much what?
- Money, dude. His family's filthy rich.

00:08:18.467 --> 00:08:19.849
They give the dojo tons of cash.

00:08:19.878 --> 00:08:21.548
That's how I keep
this place afloat.

00:08:21.577 --> 00:08:24.332
I really shouldn't be
running a business.

00:08:24.361 --> 00:08:28.048
So, wait. You don't think
he's a better person than me?

00:08:28.115 --> 00:08:30.160
No. Of course not.
He's a toilet.

00:08:30.198 --> 00:08:31.350
Jeremy, Jeremy...

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:33.875
Why didn't you tell me
this in the first place?

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:37.945
Because you and I are friends,
and that's what friends do.

00:08:37.974 --> 00:08:40.576
They do hurtful things
to each other,

00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:41.852
without explaining why,

00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:44.732
because they know
their friend will understand.

00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:47.459
That's not how... wait.
We're friends?

00:08:47.488 --> 00:08:49.475
Duh. You're my dojo bro.

00:08:49.513 --> 00:08:52.371
Why else would I keep
texting you to grab tacos?

00:08:52.405 --> 00:08:55.081
- You don't text me.
- Whose number is this then?

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.865
For the record, friends are
up front with each other.

00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:01.811
Really? I gotta stop learning
life lessons from children's shows.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.595
I'm so ignorant in
the ways of friendship.

00:09:04.633 --> 00:09:07.571
Perhaps you could be
my friendship sensei.

00:09:07.609 --> 00:09:09.692
I'd be honored.

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:14.464
Huh?

00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:19.072
Yes. Uh... yes.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.088
Yes, indeed, yes, indeed.

00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:23.814
Wonderful performance.
Just wow. Wow all across the...

00:09:23.852 --> 00:09:26.790
- But I wasn't even done.
- Yes, Grandmaster gets the gist.

00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:28.777
Punch, punch, kick, kick.
Very good, William.

00:09:28.816 --> 00:09:32.464
- It's Jeremy.
- This dojo has proven itself

00:09:32.492 --> 00:09:36.304
worthy of
Grandmaster's certification.

00:09:43.993 --> 00:09:47.900
The wind of karate
beckons once again.

00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:50.978
Grandmaster must go.

00:09:51.863 --> 00:09:54.630
Huh?
How did he do that?

00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:56.617
Huh. Grandmaster
is like the wind.

00:09:56.646 --> 00:09:59.401
He is not bound
by physical constraints.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.803
You can't leave
the Grandmaster!

00:10:03.472 --> 00:10:06.188
- Looks good.
- Sure does.

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.987
"Let's go grab some tacos."

00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:15.030
Someone invited me to get tacos.
You wanna come, too?

00:10:15.068 --> 00:10:16.864
Sure.

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:20.800
You wanna go get
some ice cream?

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:24.888
No? You wanna go...
glue some hundred-dollar bills

00:10:24.922 --> 00:10:26.406
to the ground?

00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:28.547
Yeah? Okay.

00:10:31.273 --> 00:10:34.960
* I think Earth
is a pretty great place *

00:10:34.988 --> 00:10:36.236
* That's saying something *

00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:38.896
* 'Cause I've been
through outer space *

00:10:38.934 --> 00:10:42.678
* I think it suits me,
it's just my style *

00:10:42.707 --> 00:10:46.460
* I think I'm gonna stay
a little while *

00:10:46.489 --> 00:10:50.464
* I think that strangers are
just friends you haven't met *

00:10:50.492 --> 00:10:54.304
* I'm blasting monsters
and I never break a sweat *

00:10:54.342 --> 00:10:58.182
